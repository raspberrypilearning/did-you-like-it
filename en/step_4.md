## Collect examples for training

Next, we’ll try a better approach – teaching the computer to recognise messages for itself.

+ Close the Scratch window and go back to the Training tool.

+ Click on the **< Back to project** link.

--- task ---
+ We need to collect some examples to train the computer. Click the **Train** button.
![Project main menu](images/train-model.png)

+ Click on **+ Add new label** and call it “positive comments”.  Do that again, and create a second bucket called “negative comments”. 
![2 empty classes named positive_comments and negative_comments](images/positive-and-negative.png)

+ Click on the **Add example** button in the “positive comments” bucket, and type in the nicest, comment about the movie or book you can think of. 

+ Click on the **Add example** button in the “negative comments” bucket, and type in a meanest, comment about the movie or book you can think of.

+ Continue to **Add example**s until you have got at least **six** compliments and **six** insults.
![6 examples of positive comments: "The cast were brilliant", "The plot was great", "The scenes were awesome", "The story sparked my imagination", "I loved the main character", "The soundtrack rocked" and 6 examples of negative comments: "The cast were awful", "The plot made no sense", "The scenes were too dark", "The story was boring", "I hated the main character", "The soundtrack put me to sleep"](images/example-messages.png)

title: Tips for selecting good examples
---
+ **More is good**: the more examples you give your program, the better the program should get at deciding if  your comments are positive or negative. 

+ **Equal numbers**: add roughly the same number of examples for each type of comment. If you have a lot of examples for one type and not the other, this can affect the way that the program learns to recognise them. 

+ **Make the examples really different from each other**: try to come up with lots of different types of examples. For example, make sure that you include some long examples and some very short ones.
