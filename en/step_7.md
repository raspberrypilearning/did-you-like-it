**Write a reply**: Instead of just changing the way that your character looks, make it reply, based on what it recognises in the message!

**Try a different character**: Instead of a personâ€™s face, why not try something different, like an animal?
The character could react in different ways, instead of smiling. For example, you could make a dog that wags their tail if you say something nice about the movie or book!
