## Use your machine learning model in Scratch

Now update your Scratch program to include your machine learning model instead of a rules-based approach.

--- task ---
+ Click on the **< Back to project** link.

+ Click on **Make**.

+ Click on **Scratch 3**.

+ Click the **Open in Scratch 3** button to launch the Scratch editor. You should see new blocks from your project at the bottom of the list.

+ Click on the **Code** tab, and update your Scratch code to use your machine learning model **instead** of the rules you first added.
The “recognise text … (label)” block is a new block added by your project. If you give it text, it will return return either "positive comments" or "negative comments" based on the training you’ve given to the computer.
You can use this to choose the costume to switch to.

+ Test your project 
Type a nice message and press <kbd>enter<kbd>. The character should smile.
Click the green flag again. Type a negative message and press <kbd>enter<kbd>. The character should look sad. 
Make sure you test that this works **even for messages that you didn’t include in your training.**

You’ve modified your Scratch character to use machine learning instead of your earlier rules-based approach.
Training the computer to be able to recognise messages for itself should be much quicker than trying to make a list of every possible message.
The more examples you give it, the better it should get at recognising messages correctly.
