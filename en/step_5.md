Machine Learning for Kids has added some special blocks to Scratch to allow you to use the model you just trained. 

--- task ---
+ Click on the **Code** tab, then update your Scratch code to use your machine learning model **instead** of the rules that you added earlier.
The `recognise text … (label)` block is a new block added by your project. If you give it text, it will return return either `positive comments` or `negative comments` based on the training that you’ve given to the computer.
You can use this to choose the costume to switch to.

+ Type in a nice message and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The character should smile.
Click on the **green flag** again. Type in a negative message and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The character should look sad. 
Make sure that you test that this works **even for messages that you didn’t include in your training.**
