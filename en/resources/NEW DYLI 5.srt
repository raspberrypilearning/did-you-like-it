1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:18,800
Head on over to the 'code' tab and drag 
in the code blocks to ask for a comment.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:27,120
If the comment is positive, display a smiley face.

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,960
Test your program by typing in a positive comment

4
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,560
...and you should see a smiley face!

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:44,800
Now add some more code to display a 
sad face if the comment was negative.

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,640
This time when you test, 
say that you didn't like it

7
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:59,920
...and you should see a sad face.
