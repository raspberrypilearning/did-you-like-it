1
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:07,066
Now go back, and this time click on 'make'.

2
00:00:07,232 --> 00:00:10,098
You're going to open your model in Scratch 3.

3
00:00:11,498 --> 00:00:14,531
Delete the cat and paint a new sprite.

4
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:22,229
Draw a large emoji with eyes, but don't draw a mouth.

5
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:29,894
Now right click your costume and duplicate it so that you have three the same.

6
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:36,893
Rename each costume so that you have the costumes 'not sure', 'like' and 'dislike'.

7
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:41,992
And then, draw a mouth to represent each feeling

8
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:46,918
so you end up with three different costumes.
