1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,120
Now click 'Back' and then click on 'Learn & Test'.

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,040
Start training your model, 
which might take a few minutes.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,000
When it's ready, test it by typing in a different  

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
positive comment to the ones 
that you added previously.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,320
The model should label your comment as positive.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,960
Try a negative comment too.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,720
That seems to be working.
