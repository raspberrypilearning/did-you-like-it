## Use your machine learning model in Scratch

Now, update your Scratch program to include your machine learning model instead of a rules-based approach.

--- task ---
+ Click on **< Back to project**.

+ Click on **Make**.

+ Click on **Scratch 3**.

+ Click the **Open in Scratch 3** button to launch the Scratch editor. You should see new blocks from your project at the bottom of the list. ![New machine learning blocks in Scratch 3](images/new-blocks.png)

+ Load the Scratch project that you saved earlier: click on **File**, then on **Load from your computer**, then select the Scratch project that you saved earlier. --- /task ---

--- task ---
+ Click on the **Code** tab, then update your Scratch code to use your machine learning model **instead** of the rules that you added earlier. The `recognise text … (label)` block is a new block added by your project. If you give it text, it will return return either `positive comments` or `negative comments` based on the training that you’ve given to the computer. You can use this to choose the costume to switch to. ![New scratch code including new machine learning blocks](images/code-with-new-blocks.png) --- /task ---

--- task ---
+ Click on the **green flag** to test your project again. ![Testing new code from previous instruction](images/test-ml-model-annotated.png)

+ Type in a nice message and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The character should smile. Click on the **green flag** again. Type in a negative message and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The character should look sad. Make sure that you test that this works **even for messages that you didn’t include in your training.** ![Output with sad costume](images/output-sad.png)

+ Save your project: click on **File**, then on **Save to your computer**. --- /task ---

You have now modified your Scratch character to use machine learning instead of your earlier rules-based approach. Training the computer to be able to recognise messages for itself should be much quicker than trying to make a list of every possible message. The more examples you give it, the better it should get at recognising messages correctly.
